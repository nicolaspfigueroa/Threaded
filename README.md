## Setup

- Compile all files within the "java folder".
- Open the Word document in the "textfiles" folder, visit each link, and save each file as a csv in the folder. Afterwards, remove the Word document from the folder. These serve as example files, you may enter any csv you wish.
- Run each java file in the terminal by entering "java <filename.java>" to scan a csv file for the most frequently used word.
- Each file title describes the number of threads used to scan and how many files it is capable of scanning (Ex. SingleThreadManyFiles.java will output the most used word in each file located in the "textfiles" folder using a single thread to scan).
